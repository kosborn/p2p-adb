p2p-adb Framework
=======

**Phone-2-Phone adb Framework - A project for "debugging" phones... from other phones.**

A loose framework to assist in pulling data, making system changes, etc, with minimal user input.

Goal/Reason
-----------

Attacking another device by plugging directly into it has always been something I thought would be movie hacker cool.

The real idea is that: Someone leaves their phone at the table, locked, and only for a few minutes. You pull your phone out, plug them together, and hope to god that have USB debugging enabled (all custom ROMs do.) Slurp down their files, stick your own backdoors there, and you're set to go!

Took me about 45 seconds to copy over 62MB of com.android.google.\* databases and user\_prefs files (from encrypted Galaxy Nexus to unencrypted Galaxy Nexus, but running AOKP Milestone 5).

A Framework?
------------

Yes, because as devious as I might think I am (an I am), I'm certain others have more clever ideas than mine.

As this project develops, it will form more into a framework, providing tools necessary to quickly, and sanely, allow users (i.e. you) to create scripts as easily as possible.

Requirements
------------

Most of the scripts should be doable by both PC and an Android phone.

__Note:__ This was designed for sh (not bash/dash/ksh/etc). I can't guarentee functionality will work across the shells.

Android requires:
 * An install has/supports adb (I believe stock comes with adb, otherwise you could probably add it)
 * An install that supports USB host mode
 * A phone that supports USB host mode (hardware support)
 * **Root**
 * **Busybox**
 * A terminal emulator
 * Probably a [USB On the Go cable](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=usb+otg)
 * **Check out Hak5's micro-micro USB cable: [Hak5 Shop](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/micro-to-micro-otg)**

PC requires 
 * Android SDK (specifically, you nee adb)
 * adb needs to be in $PATH
 * Something that will interpret shell scripts (I'm looking at you, Windows users. cygwin should work)

Running
------

 * Copy to phone
 * `su`
 * `sh ./run.sh`
 * profit

Targets known to be working:
 * AOKP Milestone 5
 * CyanogenMod

Targets that still have some issues:
 * Stock Android (Still figuring out the best methods to re-implement everything with a limited shell environment)
 * **Note! Stock Android is now working, busybox is now PUSHED to the device**

As necessary, I'll start expanding and building checks against certain ROMs/toolkit versions to create maximum damage.


AntiGuard
---------
AntiGuard is an Android app I wrote that will assist you in unlocking a phone.

Since ADB doesn't always give you root, you might be limited in what you can do. However, the standard ADB shell user is also very powerful.

 * AntiGuard is now built into the regular toolset!

 * To install AntiGuard, you simply need to run
   * `adb install AntiGuard/AntiGuard.apk`

 * To unlock the screen once install
   * `adb shell am start -S io.kos.antiguard/.unlock`

 * To uninstall, hit the uninstall button, or run this command
   * `adb ununinstall io.kos.antiguard`
